While in the past the average overall growth seen in the operators’ networks has been around 35%, this trend seems to keep increasing towards a 45% growth rate [Cisco2018]. Video streaming is still the dominating type of traffic nowadays, but other applications and services have appeared in the past years to stress networks even more, for example Machine-2-Machine (M2M) applications and Online Gaming, with 46% CAGR and 59% CAGR respectively. In parallel, mobile traffic (5G and Beyond-5G) is expected to play a key role in the use of telco infrastructure. Indeed, global mobile traffic is expected to grow twice as fast as IP traffic.",

In this platform, the teacher can create an escape room instance where the students can access and that once the activity has been completed, it automatically collects the progress and achievement data of the students. In addition, a methodological guide has been developed to import the concept of escape room into university education using the platform developed. ",
